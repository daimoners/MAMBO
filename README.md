MAMBO (Molecules And Materials Basic Ontology) is a domain ontology for molecular materials.
It's main targets are:
  - Allowing the retrieval of structured information regarding molecular materials and related applications (i.e. devices built with molecular materials)
  - Supporting the development of new, complex workflows for modelling systems based on molecular materials (computational modelling and data-driven techniques)
  - Integrating data generated via computational simulations and empirical experiments
